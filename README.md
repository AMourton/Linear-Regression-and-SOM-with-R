Bee Colonies Loss and its Impact on the Economy- University Project*. 

This work tests the hypothesis that the use of neonic pesticides is one of the main reasons for the phenomena called Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), leading to a massive bee colony losses. Subsequently, bee colonies loss have a negative impact on the economy.

1.	Open the R project file
2.	Open all the files listed above in R studio.
3.	Click ‘souce on save’ on the main file ‘bee_colonies.R’
4.	Save to run R script


Potential Problems

If the application encounters problems when first ran, this may be due to ‘pacman’ package manager not being installed. For this issue, please follow:
1.	In R studio select Tools > Install Packages

The datasets used for the purposes of this project were found on Kaggle.

*This is a part of a group university project. While contributing to each part of the project, my main contribution was:
- selection of the datasets
- data analysis and potential use for the chosen topic
- preprocessing in R
- report
